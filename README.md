# Running the MATLAB GUI Program

1. Launch MATLAB and Prepare the Files
- Open MATLAB.
- Download the GUI folder, open it, and run the file TwoellipsetotalareaGUI.m.
2. Input Parameters and Execute
- Select the desired ellipse equation tab, either Standard Type or General Type.
- Enter the parameters corresponding to the selected type and click the Run button.
3. View Results
- The figure will display the two ellipses, and the Result tab will show the intersection points and the overlapping area.
4. Save Results
- Click the Save button to download the table values from the Result tab as an Excel file.

# Comparison with the Monte Carlo Method
1. Launch MATLAB and Prepare the Files
- Open MATLAB.
- Download the Time_acc folder, and input the parameters for comparison into Input_E1 and Input_E2.
2. Run the Custom Method
- Execute the ellipseoverlap_time file to calculate and save the overlapping area and execution time for the ellipses using your method.
3. Run the Monte Carlo Method
- Execute the run_M file to calculate and save the overlapping area and execution time for the ellipses using the Monte Carlo method.
4. Compare Results
- Run the Compare_result_figure file to compare the relative error and relative time between the two methods.
